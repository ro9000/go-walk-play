Tree walking in Go golang, playing with queues, stacks, memory allocation. Just experimental fun.

Very curious about memory allocation in Go, and how to create massive data structures in memory while remaining efficient.

Lot of testing and playing with shared references, thankfully we have pointers.

String allocation and reallocation is also very interesting in Go, so there is a lot of code here that shuffles bytes around to learn how it all works.

This is to be used later for my bidirectional synchronization algorithms and looks very promising with speed and decent memory usage.

All in one big file for just fast hacking play. This is like publishing my scratch notes, but here it is.
